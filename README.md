# FBI's Most Wanted List
This app pulls data from the FBI's most wanted API to show the most wanted criminals in America. Users can choose to display criminals and missing persons, just criminals, or just missing persons and can also fill out a form to add a friend to the most wanted list! Friend postings are handled through a POST request using json-server and a db.json file, so POST requests are persistent.
